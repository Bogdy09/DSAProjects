**Bag Data Structure Implementation**

This project implements a Bag (or Multiset) data structure in C++, capable of storing duplicate elements and performing efficient operations. The implementation includes:

**Dynamic Resizing:** Both the primary (P) and unique (U) elements arrays are dynamically resized as needed to optimize memory usage.
**Efficient Operations:** Adding, removing, and searching for elements are implemented with attention to performance, leveraging unique elements indexing for quick access.
**Iterator Support:** A custom iterator enables traversal through the bag's elements.
**Complexity Analysis:** Each function is accompanied by detailed time complexity calculations (Best, Worst, and Average Case), ensuring transparency and understanding of performance.

**Key Functionalities**

**Add Elements:** Insert elements into the bag, managing unique and primary arrays.
**Remove Elements:** Remove specific elements or a given number of occurrences with optimized logic.
**Search Elements:** Check for the presence of an element.
**Count Occurrences:** Retrieve the number of times an element occurs.
**Iterator:** Navigate through the bag's elements using the provided iterator.
**Display Elements:** View all unique elements and their respective counts.

**Highlights**

-Detailed complexity calculations for each function to ensure efficient design and execution.
-Robust memory management through dynamic allocation and resizing.
-Well-structured code for clarity and extensibility.
