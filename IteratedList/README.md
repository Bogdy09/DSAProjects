# IteratedList

IteratedList is a dynamic singly linked list implemented using an array-based representation with open slots for efficient memory management. It supports adding, removing, searching, and iterating through elements efficiently. The accompanying ListIterator class allows for easy traversal and manipulation of the list.

## Key features:

Add/remove elements at the beginning, end, or specific positions.
Dynamic resizing for scalability.
Efficient element search and retrieval.
Iterator-based traversal for flexibility.
Ideal for managing ordered collections with dynamic size.
