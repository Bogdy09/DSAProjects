# Set Data Structure Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of a **Set** data structure in C++, built using a singly linked list. The Set ensures that only unique elements are stored and provides efficient operations for element manipulation and traversal. 

## üöÄ Features

- **Add Elements**: Add unique elements to the set; duplicates are ignored.
- **Remove Elements**: Remove specific elements efficiently.
- **Search Elements**: Check for the existence of an element in the set.
- **Iterator Support**: A custom iterator allows seamless traversal and removal of elements.
- **Size and State Queries**: Retrieve the size of the set or check if it is empty.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

- **Dynamic Memory Management**: Each element is dynamically allocated, ensuring memory is efficiently used and properly freed.
- **Robust Edge Case Handling**: The implementation gracefully handles scenarios such as removing the head node or working with an empty set.
- **Iterator Functionality**: The custom iterator supports traversal, retrieval, and removal of elements during iteration.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis

Detailed time complexity calculations for each function ensure transparency and demonstrate performance:

## üí° Highlights

- The project includes **complexity calculations** for all functions.
- Memory is efficiently managed through dynamic allocation and deallocation.
- The design ensures robust performance and handles edge cases effectively.
